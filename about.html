    Ayesha is a rising sophomore at Mentor High School, and has been part of the Mentor Science Olympiad program since 6th grade. Since then, she has accumulated a number of awards, and is a 10-time Ohio state medalist. She began coaching Mentor's middle school teams in the event Fast Facts during her freshman year, where she found her love for coaching. She saw that student numbers on the middle school teams were declining and noticed that current students on the team wished to expand their knowledge in science, so she founded Sciology to give students a taste of science over the summer and encourage more students to pursue the sciences!
